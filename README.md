# Surf's Up!

## Purpose of the Analysis
We are working to get a new business idea off the ground, a surk-n-shake shop in Hawaii that will serve surfboards and ice creams to locals and tourists all year round. Our main investor recommends to investigate weather data on Oahu to make our business plan bullet-proof.

## Key Findings

<table align="right">
  <tr height=50px>
    <th>Temperatures<br>in Oahu<br>in June</th>
    <th>Temperatures<br>in Oahu<br>in December</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="Temps_Jun.png" width = 150px>
    <td> <img src="Temps_Dec.png" width = 178px>
  </tr>
</table>

From the tables pictured right here, we can see that there are 3 key differences in weather between June and December:
1. as expected, average temperatures are lower in Dec. than in Jun. but, surprisingly, not by much: only 4°F.
2. min. temperatures are lower in Dec. than in Jun (56°F and 64°F respectively), but max. temperatures are not much higher in Jun. than in Dec. (85°F and 83°F respectively)
3. temperatures are spread out over a wider range in Dec. (stdev. = 3.75) than in Jun. (stdev. = 3.26)
4. Both Jun. and Dec. temperatures are pretty evenly distributed (mean = 74.94 and 2Q = 75.00 in Jun., and mean = 71.04 and 2Q = 71.00 in Dec.)
